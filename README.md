# Case-Closed
Hack the North 2020++ Submission

## Inspiration/ Motivation
COVID-19 has altered the lives of all people across the planet. Many have found it challenging to keep themselves and others safe, as each individual with COVID-19 experiences varying symptoms. Many have found it challenging to keep themselves and others safe, as each individual with COVID-19 experiences varying symptoms. Our team decided to create an app to help individuals track their health with respect to COVID-19 vocally, effectively allowing users to keep both themselves and their community members safe!

## What it does
The Cased Closed COVID-19 Self Assessment is a daily quiz that users can take on their mobile phone, determining what precautions they should take on a daily basis based on their answers to the quiz. The data is stored so that they can look back on their past results, look at recommendation messages uploaded in realtime, and how many days in a row they have taken the self-assessment.

## How we built it
We built this app with the help of Firebase and Android Studio. 

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into while building this app would be connecting with a cloud database, particularly with connecting voiceflow to our realtime database and relaying that data to the app.

## Accomplishments we are proud of
We are proud that we were able to save user information and authenticate through the app connecting it to the Realtime Database. We also learned how to use the API calls in Voiceflow to GET and PUSH as a team.

## What we learned
As our team are all first-time hackathon attendees and high school students this was an amazing opportunity to network and learn about software and project management. Learning to work together with people across North America even within our own team has taught us that the programming community is so robust and diverse! Also how important time-management is when you are limited to one-and-a-half days

## How Google Cloud helped to achieve the goal of your project
Google Cloud was an integral part of our User Authentication and it saved personal information. We used the Firebase Realtime Database, which was important for saving the past results of the self-assessment as well as customizing the result with their health conditions, age, and more! This made it easy to connect our saved information with the Dashboard as well as the Voiceflow Google Assistant.

## How Voiceflow helped to achieve the goal of your project
This  Self Assessment is very different and unique from others mainly due to one key factor which is the incorporation of  Voiceflow! Using this tool has helped our team achieve the goal to help support our community during these difficult times through a fun and interactive way. We have used the Voiceflow application as a big part of our project and in doing this have helped achieve our goal of bringing convenience to users through these difficult times in a fun and interactive way, that will motivate people to ensure the daily safety of them and others around. Voiceflow has ultimately helped us bring the creativeness and uniqueness to our project which makes it different and separate from the rest, while still making a huge difference in our community. It has really helped us grow our passion for helping people in some way, and now through this vocal covid self-assessment, this passion of ours will have come true.
